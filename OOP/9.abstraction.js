/*
    Abstraction:
        - Hiding something or not able to access something.
        - not being able to create object of a class.
        - now it other programming lang we have keyword 'abstract' to do that

            abstract class Father{
                //code
            }

            we cannot create a object of Father class now.
        
        - but in javascript you do not have abstract keyword.
